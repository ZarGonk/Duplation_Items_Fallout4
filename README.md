# Duplation_Items_Fallout4
This code generates an executable file (.exe) that exploits a glitch in Fallout 4, allowing items to be duplicated. The glitch works as follows:
Drop items on the ground.
Enter construction mode.
Aim at the item and press the ‘R’ key and hold for about 1 second.
Release the ‘R’ key and immediately press the ‘Tab’ key.
To avoid errors, the code has been optimized to:
Reduce the time it takes to press the ‘R’ key, minimizing the chance of an error.
Insert a small delay between releasing the ‘R’ key and pressing the ‘Tab’ key, ensuring that the actions are performed in the correct sequence.
- If you're a programmer, you can further automate the code, eliminating the need to press "Enter" manually.
